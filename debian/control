Description: XML-based report generator for PHP
 A common business need is the ability to generate reports dynamically from
 an SQL database and present the information in a tabular fashion. 
 PHPReports takes an XML definition of the general layout of the report and a
 query, and produces a finished report in one of several formats.
 .
 PHPReports is both a useful report generation package, as well as an
 excellent demonstration of the power of XML/XSLT.
